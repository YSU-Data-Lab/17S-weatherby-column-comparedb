Prior to the below dates I was taking in documentation based on MySQL, MonetDB, I briefly looked at Cassandra and want to compare benchmarks to all three. I believe that my benchmarking will be much fairer since all programs will be running from memory. Memory hierarchy played an important role in benchmarking and I am correcting this variable so it is the same across the board thus comparing only the benchmarks of the databases.

Becoming familiar with terminal and the Ubuntu server environment. Trying to upload some kind of file or documentation to GitHub.

Still fiddling with the terminal environment. It is getting easier to navigate, though I am not sure how to view or use programs yet. This has shown me really how much I take my GUI for granted.
Dr. Yu has provided me with commands to get into the MySQL (Server?) for now. I will start with this and attempt to run trials there first. After the MySQL trials are complete, I will then be concerned about getting MonetDB working.

Learned how to make files and folders within GitHub.com. Spent a lot of time googling documentation on terminal.
